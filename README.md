### Testing

Testing changes to a rust program

```
# Change to devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Build the project (takes a few mins)
cd rust
cargo build-bpf

# While you wait for the previous step to complete, find the current program id
# of the program you plan to test by searching the code base.  Save this for
# later.

# After the build step completes, deploy the program to devnet
solana program deploy ./path/to/the_program.so -u devnet

# NOTE: If you receive an error stating insufficient funds, recoup the funds
# used during the failed deployment. You may also see the following error which
# also means insufficient funds:
#     "Error: Deploying program failed: Error processing Instruction 1: custom program error: 0x1"
solana program close --buffers

# NOTE: If you had an insufficient funds, airdrop yourself some SOL, then run the deploy
# command again. I needed roughly 5 SOL to deploy the auction contract.
solana airdrop 5

# After successful deploy, a new Program Id will be printed to your terminal. Copy this
# and update the program's id everywhere in the code base. This way, during testing, we
# always call the version of the program we are testing instead of the stable one.
# DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP or you won't test your changes

# Next, comment out your js/packages/web/.env variables to force creation of a fresh new store

# Now start up the UI
cd ../js/packages
yarn && yarn bootstrap
yarn start

# Open the site in a browser in *incognito* mode http://localhost:3000

# In the incognito browser, create a new wallet by visiting https://sollet.io
# Copy the wallet address

# You'll need SOL added to the new wallet
solana airdrop 4 NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS

# Now visit the site (in incognito mode)
# Connect your new wallet
# Create a new store
# Test your program changes
```
